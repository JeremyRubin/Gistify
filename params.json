This makes it super easy to upload some text permenantly. [Here](https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5105183) is an example of a Gistified text file.\r\nIf you want to use it, just Download the source and put the service into your \r\n```\r\n/Users/Username/Library/Services\r\n```\r\ndirectory. If that fails, you can try importing through automator or just paste the source into an automator shell script with the following settings:\r\n````\r\nService receives selected files or folders in finder\r\n\r\npass input as arguments\r\n```\r\n### TODO:\r\nThere's much to be improved on this! For one, it would be nice to have the ability to post with auth instead of anonymous, and currently automator has a bug which prevents me from using the file name from sys.argv as the file name in the json.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
