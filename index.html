        <h3>Check out Gistify</h3>

<p>Gistify is a simple utility to post gists from text files in finder. This makes it super easy to upload some text permenantly. <a href="https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5105183">Here</a> is an example of a Gistified text file.
If you want to use it, just Download the source and put the service into your </p>

<pre><code>/Users/Username/Library/Services
</code></pre>

<p>directory. If that fails, you can try importing through automator or just paste the source into an automator shell script with the following settings:</p>

<pre><code>Service receives selected files or folders in finder

pass input as arguments
</code></pre>

<h3>TODO:</h3>

<p>There's much to be improved on this! For one, it would be nice to have the ability to post with auth instead of anonymous, and currently automator has a bug which prevents me from using the file name from sys.argv as the file name in the json.</p>
